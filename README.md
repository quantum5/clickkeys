# clickkeys

A tool to use keyboard buttons to click the mouse, for when your mouse button is broken.

Sometimes, your mouse button does not register when clicked, and sometimes it registers
as multiple separate clicks. This can be annoying, but you may not be able to replace it
right away. This program solves the issue.
